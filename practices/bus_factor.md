# Bus Factor

## What Is a Bus Factor

A Bus Factor defines the number of developers that are vital to a project. If something happens to them (they get hit by a bus), the project is in danger. To get hit by a bus is probably a little extreme. Consider another scenario: if a key team member takes a long vacation, the project can be easily put at risk. The goal is to increase the Bus Factor as much as possible. The best way to increase the number is by sharing the knowledge inside and outside your team.

A Bus Factor is also known as the bread truck scenario, lottery factor, truck factor, bus/truck number, or lorry factor.

## Why You Might Want to Increase Bus Factor

-   It detects the single point of failure within the team before it happens.
-   Sharing knowledge prevents the project from falling apart.
-   Trying to increase the Bus Factor continuously can give you a good control over your projects.

## Problems that Increasing the Bus Factor Solves

-   [Toxic team culture](/problems/toxic-team-culture)

## How to Increase the Bus Factor

-   **Reassign**  
    Usually, the project relies on one or a few "heroes". The company has to be prepared for them to leave. Reassign the heroes to a different part of your project or to a completely different task. Their replacement will have time to ask them questions while the heroes are still part of the company. The heroes can be very useful in their new area as well.  

-   **Code Reviews**  
    Code Review helps to find bugs and helps to ensure that other developers get familiar with your project. Also, shared responsibility creates a friendlier atmosphere.  
    For more information, see [Code Review](/practices/code-review).  

-   **Improve the level of your juniors**  
    It is important to let the juniors become valuable team members as soon as possible. Do not always give complex and difficult projects to the senior developers. Juniors might spend longer time figuring the projects out, but they can always ask for help. Discussing the issues with more advanced colleagues makes juniors grow fast.  

-   **Pair programming**  
    Fixing the bugs can be done by someone who did not write the code (if it does not need to be fixed as soon as possible).  
    For more information, see [Pair Programming](/practices/pair-programming).  

-   **Regular meetings**  
    If your team does not do daily standups, ensure to meet all the team members from time to time to share critical information.  
    For more information, see [Agile Events](/practices/agile-events).  

-   **Write explicit code**  
    It is very helpful if anyone can read your code. You can improve your style, structure, or naming. Also commenting is useful.
    For more information, see [Poor Code Quality](/problems/poor-code-quality).  

-   **Stay close to the domain**  
    You should understand your clientâ€™s domain. You can use the same vocabulary as your client to save by trying to understand what they are trying to say. Help them with the description. Write it all down in a glossary.  

-   **Write tests and documentation**  
    Functional tests help developers to understand the project very quickly. Document (at least) the main goals of your project.  
    For more information, see [Software Documentation](/practices/software-documentation), or [Performance Testing](/practices/performance-testing).

## Common Pitfalls of Increasing the Bus Factor

-   Team substitutability is missing. It seems like everyone is familiar with the product but there is only one person (or a few) that can release it. This can be prevented by automatization.
-   The Bus Factor is hidden. It does not have to be only about the deep knowledge of your project. It can be just one password that is not shared and hides an important part of the project.
-   The documentation is nonexisting. If the developers do not share their ideas, it is very important to write them down.

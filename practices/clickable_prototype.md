# Clickable Prototype

## What Is a Clickable Prototype

A Clickable Prototype shows a visual representation of the user interface of a website or software application. Unlike static wireframes or mockups, it can show more than one state of the application - for example, a drop-down menu may appear. The interactive experience is very similar to a finalized application.

Prototypes are often made in the cheapest way and usually at a lower level of detail than a final product.

## Why You Might Want the Clickable Prototype

A Clickable Prototype is used as a presentation of the various project stakeholders to gather more accurate feedback (typically via UX tests) from:

-   Product owners/decision makers choose what is in and out of scope and what is part of MVP. Clickable Prototypes help to generate support, gain agreement or even investment for the project.
-   Developers better understand the product. A prototype may reduce misunderstanding between developers and product owners or UX experts.
-   End users get better product. By using prototyping as an agile tool it is possible to test theories and ideas (for example, design or layout of the website). Prototypes helps prevent changes on the finalized product.

Based on text above, process of software development which uses prototyping can be faster and more cost-effective than programming.

## How to Implement the Clickable Prototype

It is recommended to start with a simple wireframe (pen + paper) your head thinks only about the prototype, and not about the tool. If your paper Clickable Prototype is not sufficient for the purpose, continue with advanced prototyping.

It is good to keep particular versions of the prototype because you might want to come back to an initial idea during the project. It is possible to reuse some components among projects (for example, a menu bar across a corporate internet banking system).

There is a lot of prototyping tools on the market, such as [Axure](https://www.axure.com/), [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/), [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/), [Proto.io](https://proto.io/) or [Justinmind](https://www.justinmind.com/). It is not impossible to create a great prototype with PowerPoint or Keynote. A prototyper is usually a UX designer and does not necessarily have developer skills.

## Common Pitfalls of Clickable Prototype

-   A Clickable Prototype usually clarifies communication between decision makers and the rest of the team. Sometimes it can conversely cause a slowdown of development, for example UX specialist/prototyper is on the other end of the globe than product owner and developer. Communication can be in this case very difficult.
-   It follows the point above: sometimes can be programming cheaper and faster than prototyping and a paper or blackboard wireframe might be sufficient. Consider whether it is necessary.
-   The level of detail of the Clickable Prototypes should depend on the type of project. For example, a prototype for usability testing may be more closer to the reality than for presentation on management board.
-   Stakeholders sometimes think the product is done. Make sure that they have enough information.
